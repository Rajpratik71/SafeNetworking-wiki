This project and everyone participating in it is governed by the [SafeNetworking Code of Conduct](https://github.com/PaloAltoNetworks/safe-networking/blob/master/docs/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).

## I don't want to read this whole thing I just have a question!!!

> **Note:** Please don't file an issue to ask a question. You'll get faster results by using the resources below.

We ***will*** have an official message board with a detailed FAQ and where the community chimes in with helpful advice if you have questions.  Until that official message board is up and running, you can email the [SP-Solutions](mailto:sp-solutions@paloaltonetworks.com) with your question.

If chat is more your speed, we have an internal [SafeNetworking Slack Channel](https://paloaltonetworks.slack.com/messages/C8ZLEQX7S) - Please note that this is for Palo Alto Networks employees only at this time.

We are working on a SafeNetworking Slack Channel for external peeps - check back for status!!!
